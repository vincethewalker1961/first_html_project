		Sat 11th April,
Early start at 6:45 to make it to Mannum. We had breakfast in Arrarat and ordered Dad his weekly egg and bacon roll. 
Uneventful trip until crossing the ferry over the Murray when the ferry captain told us a tyre on the caravan looked very flat. 
We went to a servo to pump it up and found the valve leaked. We had to change to the spare tyre as nothing was open to fix it. 
Then we put up the caravan and discovered a light had been left on and had burned a few holes in the canvas. Lucky it is fire retardant. 
We patched it up. Lesson for the day. Teach the greenhorns, don't assume anything. Went to the Pretoria hotel for dinner and Dad got a blood nose  which took a while, and 35 serviettes, to stop bleeding. 
We have to stop him fighting with the locals!

Another long day but uneventful this time. I got my distances wrong in the itinerary I had 605 ks but we ended doing 826 to Ceduna. Luckily we worked it out before lunch and ate while we drove. Did our first cooking of a bit of boerie on the Barbie.

		<th colspan=“4”>Monday 13th April, Slow start as the plan was only to go 495 ks to Eucla. However chatted to our neighbour in Ceduna who told us it would take 14 hours to drive to Kalgoorlie, so we would be better splitting the distance and going further today if we could. We decided to go to Cocklebiddy . Stopped to see the great australian bight, the Royal Flying Doctor Service runway on the road and the landscape. This is when I discovered we had the paparazzi aboard who wanted to stop and photograph anything that looked like it wasn't made in the UK. I made the arbitrary decision to limit photo stops to 3 a day. This way we won't take 3 weeks to get to  Perth. Met a cyclist couple who are riding to Perth from Melbourne with no support. They were staying overnight at the bight lookout (ie.  the middle of nowhere). They do about 80ks a day and each carry 10 litres of water, and probably a lot of saddle cream too. At Eucla went to see the old Telegraph station covered in dunes. We walked through a crowd of people milling around the carpark and went to see the old telegraph station where we discovered a dude dressed up as a pirate. He asked us to keep quiet until the crowd on a golfing tour came through After a speech from the tour guide he jumped out and suprised them. I was more suprised by the lame pirate accent and how much the golfing tourists loved it.He then told them to dig for treasure in a designated area where  one lucky golfer found a $1200 diamond ring. We lost our honey at the WA border and also the death of my left thong. But we gained 90 minutes to get us to cocklebiddy. Only problem it is pitch black at 6pm and we will only get there at 6:30. It is very dangerous driving at night here and we let a truckie pass us and he hit a kangaroo and pushed it into the middle of the road. We drove passed it with the tail still twitching. The truckie stopped to check his rig was ok. We pulled up next to him to see if he needed any help. Where else can you stop and have a conversation while blocking up the number 1 national highway. Cockle.biddy was a servo and a diner and that's about all. The food was designed for truckies so we had a good feed. Stabbed myself in the hand with a screwdriver but that's a story for another day.

Back to Perth and then to the airport to drop off Vincent. Managed to find the correct terminal after navigating through a maze of roadworks. They don't do their roadwork projects one after the other, they do them all simultaneously it seems. It was sad to see Vince off as he was great company, however on the bright side we are getting better fuel consumption now and the chocolate bill has halved.
We decided to do some maintenance today and ripped out the old microwave, opened it up to see if it could be fixed, but in the end consigned it to the scrap heap. Dad has had to go back to the basics now for making his morning oats, gathering firewood, making a fire, boiling a billy and then adding his oats.

Drove to Margaret River today and stopped in Bunbury to shop for Liz's birthday present. Found a great microwave at Kmart at a bargain price. Top of the range in stainless steel - I think she will really like it. Got into the caravan park early before the long weekend rush. It is a long weekend in WA due the Anzac Day holiday they get on Monday, so the caravan park is full.

		<th colspan=“4”>Saturday 25th April - Anzac Day
Spent the day being tourists, started off driving through Margaret River and down to the Cape Leeuwin lighthouse. The lighthouse is the biggest in WA but small compared to Stevens head in his selfie ( see photo Vince). Cape Leeuwin is where the Indian Ocean and the Southern ocean meet and there have been many shipwrecks before the lighthouse was erected.
Next stop was the Margaret river surfing competition site. We were a day after the competition finished but the surf conditions are awesome (coming from a non-surfer). The swells keep coming in from about a kilometre out at sea. There were plenty of surfers riding the waves. 
Next stop the wineries. This is the reason Steven came on the trip and he has endured 2 weeks patiently waiting to hit the cellar door tastings. Went to three wineries, vases Felix, Cullen and Evans and Tate. Bought some expensive wine to take back to our better halves.
The final stop of the day was the chocolate factory, but Steven had drunk so much he thought it was another winery. He tasted the chocolate massage oil and even bought a bottle. I think he will sleep well tonight. I think Vince would have really liked this place as you could scoop handfuls of chocolate into your hand and eat as much as you liked. He will have to superimpose his picture into the one we took of Steven out the front. He was with us in spirit and we ate extra chocolate on his behalf.

		<th colspan=“4”>Sunday 26th April
We had Sussed out the fishing spots the day before and decided Gracetown was the best bet. It had a boat ramp sheltered by a rocky outcrop and deep open ocean on the other side of the outcrop. We started near the boat ramp to try catch some baitfish for bigger fish later. We had my secret bait of marinated chicken fillets and it did not disappoint. Steven and I both caught good size herring on our first cast - this was my kind of fishing spot! Steven caught 2 more herring and we decided it was enough for live bait in the open ocean. The open ocean had a rocky drop off into deeper water and we were there just on high tide. The live bait worked wonders and Steven hooked a large salmon and brought it in close before it snapped the line. He then hooked another and carefully played it until it was close to the shore. I scrambled down and grappled the last bit of line to pull it onto the rocks but again the line snapped. The salmon were about 80cm. I then hooked up something very large and could not budge it at all to reel it in. It then took off into the open ocean and my reel was screaming as the line peeled off. I applied the drag gradually but then the line snapped. It must have been Jaws or Moby Dick. We decided to call it a session and were feeling a bit guilty as we had left Dad waiting in the car since 9:00 am and it was now 12:30. He was fine reading his book and watching the girls in bikinis walk by.
We decided we needed expert advice on how to land these big fish so I put a call in to the fishing Guru Boland-San. The guru said we needed a gaff, so we spent an hour coming Margaret river for one. We could only get a big hook which we attached to a big stick with wire and gaffa tape. Then we went fishing at the same spot again. Alas the salmon did not come back, I caught the ugliest fish I have ever seen, it had a mouth like a vacuum cleaner, a fat stomach, leathery wrinkled skin and a raspy wheeze as I tried to get the hook out. Needless to say we through it back. I then caught a nice black bream which is in the freezer for dinner later on. This was probably the best days fishing I have ever had. Will have to remember Grace town for the next trip.

		<th colspan=“4”>Monday 27th April - getting close!
Early start and drove to Pemberton where we stopped for coffee. It is a great little scenic village in the forest and popular with young couples, judging by the attractiveness of the patrons in the cafe. We were heading to Bremmer Bay here I had booked accommodation at the Rest Point Resort. As we drive through Walpole I saw a sign to the Rest Point Resort. I thought it was too much of a coincidence that both Bremmer Bay and Walpole had the same resort, so I rang up to confirm. Sure enough I had booked accommodation at the wrong town. I had to cancel it and rebook at the right place. On the road in to Bremmer Bay we came across an accident that had just happened. We saw a caravan just off the road that had half it's side torn apart and further up the road a Holden Commodore in the bushes. It had major damage to the front panel and wheels fallen off. We stopped to help and were abducted by aliens!. Only joking, no one was seriously injured and they said help had been called so we drove on. I think the caravan might have been swaying and both cars were too close to the centre of the road on a narrow road. Checked in to the caravan park and went fishing at the boat ramp for baitfish. Got a few bait fish ready for the assault on the salmon first thing in the morning.

		<th colspan=“4”>Tuesday 28th April  - it's my birthday!
Went fishing at 6:45 am at the recommended "short beach" and after an hour of no action, the salmon finally arrived. After losing his sinker Steven just threw on a sardine and threw his line in with no sinker. He hooked a big salmon and I pounced on it once he dragged it out the water. I then cast in and hooked a big one which we landed as well. We had two big salmon in the space of 5 minutes. Enough for us to eat so we measured the fish and released Steve's 67cm tiddler  back into the ocean to grow up. We kept my 70cm monster that weighed 3.62kg. Biggest fish I have ever caught, not bad by 9:30am on my birthday.
On the road to Esperanto we were first on the scene of an accident. I pulled up to the T junction turnoff to Bremmer bay and looked left. I saw a small cloud of smoke and dust. When the smoke cleared there was a car rolled on its side lying in the ditch with its headlights still on. We rushed over to assist and as we got there, a guy  climbed out of the side door that was the roof. He was shaken but unhurt. We helped him until he had contacted relatives from Albany to come fetch him. He had water and seemed ok so we left him to await the tow truck. His car was a right-off. He reckons he saw something like a roo on the road and swerved. Either that or a text message.

		<th colspan=“4”>Wednesday 29th April - Liz's Birthday
Started the day leisurely and went for the scenic ocean drive around Esperance. Esperance is absolutely gorgeous, it has pristine beaches one after the other for about 15 kms. Each one has clean sand and almost no-one on them. They are on a bay with lots of little islands, so there are no big waves and great vista of the islands. If Esperance was not so bloody far from anywhere else, it would have another 500,000 people trying to retire down here, it is truly idyllic. It puts the Victorian great ocean road to shame, and that's coming from a Victorian. It also has fish! I went onto the jetty and as I was walking there I chatted to and off fella who was going fishing. He said it was better to fish at the beginning of the jetty near the rocks. He was a bit deaf so instead of answering my questions he just told me a bit of info about fishing. I ignored his advice and went out onto the jetty. I caught 4 small herring in about 90 minutes. Steven and dad had walked over and we decided to leave. Steven chatted to the old fisherman and he had 4 fish in his bucket, rock cod, sweeps and another type. I stayed another 30 mins and fished off the rocks and caught 5 more fish, including 3 rock cod. I should have listened to the old guy in the first place.
Found a great fishing tackle shop and spent an hour there picking out a nice gift for Liz's Birthday.
Tomorrow we start 4 long days of driving to get across the Nullarbor and home.</th></tr></table>

Early start as the sun comes up at 6:30. We were on the road by 7:45. It was a long day in the car as we did 835 kms. We stopped overnight at the Mandrabilla roadhouse, and had or last caravan cooked dinner - toasted sandwiches with a nice Margaret River Shiraz.

		<th colspan=“4”>Friday 1st May - I think
Filled up with enough petrol to get to the Nullarbor Roadhouse where we expect petrol to be cheaper. It goes up 40 cents a litre across the middle section of the Nullarbot. When we got to Nullarbor, it was the most expensive petrol so far at $1.80 a litre. We decided we had sufficient to get to the Yalata roadhouse and get petrol there. When we got to Yalata, it was closed and we could not get petrol. It was 52 ks to the next roadhouse, Nundroo, and our cars computer said our range was 51 ks so we would be short by 1 k. We had no choice and went own, with Steven trying to drive economically. The great trip computer decided it would not work below 50 kms range left in the tank, so we had no idea how we were tracking. I digress to complain about the Hyundai trip computer that does not help you when you most need it, when you are running out of petrol. Furthermore while I am on the subject, the Hyundai dims the instrument panel when you switch on the lights. Makes sense, but not in outback Australia where it is safer to keep your lights on. This means with your sunnies on, you cannot read the instrument panel. I think if they want to sell there cars as being adapted to Australian conditions, they should come for a drive in the outback. Sorry about the vent, It may be because i have been stuck in the car and caravan for 2 days and have not been able to fish. 
Back to the running out of petrol saga. There were two outcomes, 1we just made it and 2 we ran out of petrol before reaching Nundroo. We were holding our breath but made it and were relieved to fill up. I am looking forward to showing Steven and Dad the huge jetty in Caduna. Each time I tell them how long it is I exaggerate just a little. It is now up to 4 kms long. I hope they are not disappointed. 
The long jetty has gone! It is not there anymore. They must have moved it or I have the wrong town/jetty combo.
We were advised to go to the Ceduna sailing club for dinner and we were not disappointed. We thought of Vince as we tucked into a succulent fillet mignon. I felt a bit guilty as when we passed through Ceduna the first time we had boerie cooked in the camp kitchen - sorry Vince.
Went for my last fish on the shortened jetty and caught a green leatherjacket.</th></tr></table>

		<th colspan=“4”>Saturday 2nd May.
Started at 8:00 am as we have to do 825 kms to get to Mannum tonight. We have to get there by 6pm before the office closes at the caravan park. Stopped in Kimba for a coffee and saw the quintessential Aussie truckie. He weighed about 150 kegs and was about 6 foot 6. He was squeezed into a pair of Warwick Capper workwear shorts. His legs were like a ghost gums trunk, white and thick. He had short socks and a pair of boots on. He ordered a hamburger, a pie and a chicko roll, all for himself at 11 am. I would have loved to get a photo of him but did not have the guts to ask.
